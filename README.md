# 🚀 iOS Developer Roadmap 
The definitive guide to becoming an iOS developer in 2018.

## ☝️ What is it?
This is a tree-like compilation of topics highly relevant to iOS development. Both the image and text versions are generated from human readable content files.

## ✌️ Who is it for?
This roadmap is intended for the following audiences:

- Anyone looking to become a professional iOS developer.
- Entry-level software engineers who need to brush up on knowledge in a variety of topics to prepare for interviews.
- Mid-level iOS developers who want to become experts in their craft.
- Senior iOS developers and hiring managers seeking a curated list of topics for interview questions.

## 👌 Why these topics?
See [this article](https://medium.com/@borlov/c9a24f413457) explaining selection of topics.

## 👨‍🎓 How to use this roadmap
1. Navigate to the [Text Version with Study Materials](RoadmapProject/Script/Generated/ROADMAP.md).
2. Choose a topic and click the link to view the corresponding resources.
3. Study until you can confidently explain the topic to your pet 🐶🐱.
4. When you complete a topic, edit the checkbox from within markdown file. [How to tick a checkbox](HowTo/HOWTOCHECKBOX.md).
5. Repeat ♻️.

Some items are marked as `Essential topics`, or topics that significantly contribute to your understanding of iOS development. If you are short on time, it is a good idea to study these topics first, as they tend to come up often during interviews.

For complete beginners, it is suggested that you start from the `Getting started` section.
